##  Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a food delivery dataset to identify key variables affecting delivery time. It provides visual insights and prepares the ground for predictive modeling in later stages.

---

##  Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw delivery data  
- Visualize key factors affecting delivery duration  
- Derive actionable business insights  
- Lay foundation for building a prediction model

##  Dataset

- **Filename:** `food_delivery_data.csv`  
- **Size:** ~1000+ records  
- **Features include:**  
  - Delivery location  
  - Weather and traffic conditions  
  - Restaurant and rider ratings  
  - Time taken for delivery  

---

##  Key Insights

- Traffic and weather significantly impact delivery time  
- Certain restaurant types consistently take longer to deliver  
- Low rider ratings correlate with longer delivery durations  
- Peak hours introduce significant variance in delivery delays  

---

##  Business Value

Platforms like **Zomato** can use these insights to:

- Optimize rider assignments during peak hours  
- Improve ETA accuracy to boost customer trust  
- Identify high-delay restaurants or zones  
- Support logistics planning and route optimization
